    "intro": "The honesty of taste begins with the honesty of process. Every step â€” from milk to packaging â€” is under my personal attention and responsibility. I make cheese the way I would want it to be made for me.",

    "point1title": "Milk",
    "point1": "I use only high-quality farm milk from a single trusted supplier. Everything thatâ€™s in the milk is revealed in the cheese â€” tenfold. Thatâ€™s why milk is the foundation of purity, freshness, and flavor.",

    "point2title": "Pasteurization",
    "point2": "All cheeses are made exclusively from pasteurized milk. This is my principle â€” safety and consistent quality matter more than the easy way.",

    "point3title": "Cultures and Enzymes",
    "point3": "Only European cultures and enzymes â€” French, Italian, and time-tested.",

    "point4title": "Facility and Refrigeration",
    "point4": "Cheeses mature in a specially equipped room â€” separate, clean, and designed specifically for cheesemaking. Refrigerators are professional and dedicated solely to cheese.",

    "point5title": "Precision Instruments",
    "point5": "I trust intuition but verify with numbers. pH meters, thermometers, and timers are my allies in a craft where precision matters.",

    "point6title": "Packaging",
    "point6": "Each piece is wrapped by hand, carefully and respectfully. I use special micro-perforated paper made in France, which allows the cheese to breathe and stay fresh longer.",

    "point7title": "Delivery",
    "point7": "The cheese travels to you as I would deliver a gift to a friend â€” gently, with temperature and time control. A thermal box with cooling ensures its quality."
